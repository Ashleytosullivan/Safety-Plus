# Safety Plus
Individual Formative Assignment: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

# Introduction
Safety Plus! is a my first assessed project for the AI Assisted Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp.
This project will be utilising HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & Microsoft Copilot assisted code to fulfill the brief for this project.
Safety Plus! is a handy cybersecurity guide for adults to safely navigate the tricky worldwide web.

# Introduction

With this project I wanted to create a simple guide for people who may struggle with tech literacy to navigate the treacherous water of the world wide web.
People are taught to troubleshoot and use critical thinking less and less when it comes to technology, so I believe easy guides will be useful to avoid issues.


## User Stories 
* As a user, I want to understand better how to avoid security risks
* As a user I want to be able to find resources to help me understand what cybersecurity is 
* As a user I want to be able to navigate the website easily via a menu
* As a user I want to be able to view this website on a phone, tablet and computer screen
* As a user I want social media pages to follow for more help
* As a user I want easy to udnerstand tips and guidelines


I used Microsoft Copilot to generate user stories for this section, editing them for simplicity and ease of hitting the criteria of this project.
Using these stories, I created a project plan to meet these objectives.



# Initial Design with Wireframes

Wireframes have been created using Balsamiq. The goal was to create an easy to navigate and understand page, as this project is aimed at those who may struggle with tech literacy.

The layout for these changed slightly throughout the coding process. Utilising Bootstrap 5.3, the initial designs were met, however the key difference implemented was a carousel to the testimonials section. This is to make the page less busy and utilise more of the learned material throughout the course so far.

## Fonts

Fonts were a large consideration for this project and were selected and implemented via Google Fonts. The aim was to find one that was easy to read yet not dull. Described in my notes as a "business casual" font. After implementing a number of font styles, eventually I decided to use "Roboto" as the main font.

## Colours
The colour scheme was a large consideration for this project. I elected to use the below palette as they were nicely contrasting colours and when implemented, met the WCAG critera for accessibility.

## Features

### General Features 

To fill the criteria of the project, the page includes numerous features, coded manually, using Microsoft Copilot and the Bootstrap 5.3 framework.

#### Navigation Section
The Navbar was created using the standard Bootstrap Navbar and manually modified to use the relevant navigation links. Adding to it also a Lock Symbol and "burger" dropdown symbol, both from https://fontawesome.com/ 

#### Hero Section

The Hero Section was created using a prompt with Microsoft Copilot. This initially placed the header and paragraph texts below the hero image, requiring manual intervention. Utilising code suggestions from https://www.w3schools.com/ I adjusted the HTML and CSS code to include the text overlay class, adjusting it to how I wished for it to appear. Another issue caused by Copilot was the sizing of the hero image on smaller screens, which required manual targeting and media queries to fix.
